# Overview

This is a pet project that utilizes an Explcit Finite-Difference Method (FDM) to approximate and discretize a value to a European Put Option. Furthermore, it then compares that numerical solution to the Black-Scholes Model's assigned value. Finally, we quantify the error. 

Here is a complete breakdown of how it works:
